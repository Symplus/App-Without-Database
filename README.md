# App-Without-Database

This is our working version of our Symplus app. This version does not have a database implementation.
To run our app on either OSX or Windows be sure to have the latest version of Android Studio on your computer and 
import the project from the welcome screen. Once imported, to run the app, either press the green play button or in the 
toolbar, Run->Run"app". The options to run in the emulator will come up. To run on an android device, you must first 
enable developer options. See the link below to enable devolper options. Once enabled run the project as before and the option
to run on your phone should appear.
